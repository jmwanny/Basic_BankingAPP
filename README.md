# Basic_BankingAPP
A desktop-based banking application developed as our final project in Programming 2. The Application features an MPIN login (1234) that grants access to a main menu where users           can deposit funds, withdraw money, check their balance, or exit the system. The system supports a single hardcoded user account (no database integration yet).
